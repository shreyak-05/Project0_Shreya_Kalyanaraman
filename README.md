Scenario 1: The TurtleBot moved at a constant velocity to reach a specific coordinate along a straight line, following the equation x=v⋅t, where x represents the displacement, v is the constant velocity, and t is the time.


Scenario 2: The TurtleBot begins moving with an initial acceleration (a), accelerating until it reaches a certain speed (v). It then continues to move at this constant velocity (v) over a distance of x2​. Finally, the TurtleBot decelerates with a negative acceleration (- a) until it comes to a complete stop.
